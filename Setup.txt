If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. 
You can make a dump of it by entering 
  SELECT rental_id FROM rentals INNER JOIN customers USING(customer_id) WHERE phone='555-
5555'
  in a bash terminal (not the psql one). 
It will save the commands to rebuild your database in bikes.sql. 
The file will be located where the command was entered. 
If it's anything inside the project folder, the file will be saved in the VM. 
You can rebuild the database by entering 
  psql -U postgres < bikes.sql  
  in a terminal where the .sql file is.
